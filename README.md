# TicTacToe
Project for University

TicTacToe is a Java application which allows you to play TicTacToe with a friend or with computer. 
Each player can take turns to play and in the moment a player has managed to position three symbols in a row, column or diagonal on the 3x3 grid the game will announce the winner.
But the game doesn't end when we have a winner. You can restart the game anytime and play again while the overall score is keept and shown on the game frame.
